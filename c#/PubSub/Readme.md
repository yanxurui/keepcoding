This demonstrates how to broadcast messages to all subscribers using Grpc.AspNetCore server streaming API efficiently.
I tested on my laptop. The latency is less than 10 miliseconds when there are thousands of subscribers.

How does it work? Let's take a look at how the server handles requests.

1. Create a SemaphoreSlim for each new request and put it in a global queue. The request is listening to the semaphore (using await).
2. If there is any thing to broadcast, there is a background task that iterates the queue and wakes up every listener.
